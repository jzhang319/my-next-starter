# My NEXT.js Starter

This is a custom project starter for a full-stack Next.js app using Supabase for the database and authentication.

## Getting Started


First, install dependencies with `npm install` in the root directory, then start the development server with `npm run dev`:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses Cookie-based Auth with Supabase, Supabase as the database, and Next.js as the frontend framework.
